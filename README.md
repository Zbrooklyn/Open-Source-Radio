# Open-Source-Radio

The objective of open source radio is to provide unrestricted communication access to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or location. The idea is rooted in the belief that communication is a fundamental human right and should be as free from restriction as possible.

When we think of communication devices, the first thing that comes to mind is usually the ubiquitous cell phone. However, there are many other devices that people use to communicate, including 2-way radios or walkie-talkies. In fact, 2-way radios are still commonly used today in various industries such as aviation, construction, and emergency services.

One of the most popular 2-way radio models in the market today is the Baofeng radio. It has gained a large community of users due to its simplicity and affordability. However, the Baofeng radio is not open source, which means that users cannot customize or modify it to suit their needs.

That's where the concept of creating an open source version of the Baofeng radio comes in. By using an Arduino or an ESP32, we could make an open source 2-way radio that is not only affordable and easy to use, but also highly customizable. For example, users could install updates from the internet, expand memory storage, or add different channel groups to suit their specific needs.

Creating an open source version of the Baofeng radio would not only provide users with more freedom and flexibility, but it would also promote innovation and collaboration among the community. Developers and enthusiasts could work together to improve the design and functionality of the radio, creating new opportunities for communication and connectivity.

In conclusion, the objective of open source radio is to provide unrestricted communication access to everyone, and creating an open source version of the Baofeng radio would be a great step towards achieving that goal. It would not only provide users with more freedom and flexibility, but also promote innovation and collaboration among the community.


So lets look at the features, the pros and cons lets and if its possible to make some basic  improvements with an open source  model.
